# Leaderboard Data Simulator
 
A simple ruby script for mocking live leaderboard data. Running the script will update the leaderboard data every 0.5s and post the leaderboard as json to http://localhost:3000/receiver/leaderboard/FT7E3Y68UPA6

To run the script simply `cd` to the enclosing folder and run `ruby mock_leaderboard_data.rb` it will keep running forever so close it when cmd^c or ctrl^c when finished
